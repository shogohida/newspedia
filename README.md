# Main features
With this app, you can gather articles from several websites like The New York Times, Wikipedia, BBC, The Guardian.  
It also enables you to search articles by country. For example, if you select any Spanish speaking country, you get articles in Spanish.  
You can also get COVID-19 information by country and make graphs of confirmed cases, the number of deaths and active patients.

# Background
The reason why I created this app is that I used to analyse political and economic news during my professional career (at the Embassy of Japan in Guatemala and a think tank in Japan) and that I wanted to have an app which sorts those news easily.
